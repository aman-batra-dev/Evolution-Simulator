# Evolution Simulator



## Introduction

In my project, the Evolution Simulator, I've created a virtual playground where square creatures navigate a simple world. These creatures have brains called neural networks that help them decide whether to move left, right, forward, or backward. I built this using Unity 3D, a game development tool.

The simulation happens in short 10-second rounds, during which I check how close each creature is to safe areas. I decide how well a creature is doing based on whether it's in a safe spot or not. The magic happens through a genetic algorithm, a kind of behind-the-scenes process inspired by nature. I select the best creatures, mix their "genetic" information, and introduce small changes for diversity.

As these creatures go through many rounds, their decision-making gets better, mirroring how animals adapt in the real world. My project aims to show how this process works visually, providing a simple and engaging way to understand concepts like neural networks and evolution.

Looking forward, I might make small adjustments for better performance, add a few more things for creatures to do, or maybe show some interesting data as the simulation runs. My Evolution Simulator is a humble attempt to make complex ideas about brains and evolution easy to grasp and fun to explore.
